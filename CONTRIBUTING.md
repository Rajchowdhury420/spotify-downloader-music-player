- Here is a basic outline on opening issues and making PRs:

## Opening Issues

- Search for your problem in the
[issues section](https://github.com/rpotter12/spotify-downloader-music-player/issues)
before opening a new ticket. It might be already answered and save both you and us time. :smile:
- Provide as much information as possible when opening your ticket, including any relevant examples (if any).
- If you think your question is naive or something and you can't find anything related,
don't feel bad. Open an issue any way!

## Making Pull Requests

- When making a PR, point it to the [master branch](https://github.com/rpotter12/spotify-downloader-music-player/tree/master)
unless mentioned otherwise.
- If you are planning to work on something big, let us know through an issue. So we can discuss more about it.
- Lastly, please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions!
Let us know (through an issue) if you are facing any trouble making a PR, we'd be glad to help you out!
